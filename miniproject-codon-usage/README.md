# Codon Usage Miniproject
## Jander Kugelman

Miniproject 2 to translate codons into amino acids, count the proportion, and compare amino acid composition between different proteins.

## Usage
codon-usage.py parses through fasta files and prints the identifier of each sequence and prints each codon in the sequence. The script is correct because for each sequence in the fasta file, the identifier is printed to the terminal following by the codons in the sequences, starting with a methionine and ending with a stop codon.
